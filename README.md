# agentdrop

**Dotfiles for your coding agents.**

You keep one set of working rules and run one command. After that, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode and Command Code all read the same instructions. The command also sets up a new project with a docs layout that agents keep tidy.

```sh
agentdrop .          # set up the current project
```

The script is a single Python file with no dependencies and never overwrites what you wrote.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/danzerzine/agentdrop
python3 agentdrop/agentdrop --install
```

This copies the script to `~/.local/bin` and creates `~/.agentdrop/COMMON.md` (your rules) and `~/.agentdrop/kit/` (the project skeleton). It then syncs the rules into every harness's global config:

| Harness | Where the rules go |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/rules/agentdrop-common.md` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (or `AGENTS.override.md` if you use one) |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` |
| Command Code | `~/.commandcode/AGENTS.md` |

Existing files keep their content. agentdrop only adds or updates a block between `<!-- AGENTDROP:… -->` markers and backs up every file to `~/.agentdrop/backups/` before it touches it.

### Windows

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/danzerzine/agentdrop
python agentdrop\agentdrop --install
```

On Windows, `--install` puts three files into `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin`:
- `agentdrop.py`;
- `agentdrop.cmd`, the launcher for cmd and PowerShell;
- `agentdrop`, the launcher for Git Bash.

The launchers look for a working `python`, then fall back to `py -3`. That way they skip the Microsoft Store stub and cope with pyenv-win's `.bat` shims.

The folder goes onto your user PATH directly in the registry, not through `setx`. `setx` truncates a long PATH. Open a new terminal afterwards.

Other Windows behaviour:
- Files keep their line endings and BOM.
- The console prints ASCII when it can't show `✓`.
- The kit's shell scripts are written with LF, because a clone with `core.autocrlf=true` would give them CRLF.
- `agentdrop edit` uses `$EDITOR`, then the `.md` association, then Notepad.
- The docs question needs a console. If Git Bash skips it, run agentdrop from cmd or PowerShell, or pass `--docs`. The `.git-docs` commands it prints use double quotes, so they paste into cmd as well.

The docs guard and the git hook need `bash`. Git for Windows ships it, and Claude Code uses it for hooks.

## Everyday use

```sh
agentdrop edit              # open your rules (COMMON.md)
agentdrop sync              # push edited rules to all harnesses
agentdrop .                 # set up or refresh the project you're in
agentdrop ~/code/app        # same, for another path
agentdrop --dry-run .       # show what would change
agentdrop --docs separate . # keep the docs out of the code repo (see below)
```

## What a project gets

```
AGENTS.md                  your project notes on top, managed block below
CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md      one-line @AGENTS.md imports
docs/
  CONTEXT.md               what the product is, who uses it, glossary
  DECISIONS.md             decision log: what, why, what was rejected
  CONVENTIONS.md           "we always do it this way"
  PITFALLS.md              traps someone already fell into
  OPERATIONS.md            how to run, deploy, access (no secrets)
  STATE.md                 what works right now
  TODO.md                  tickets B1, B2… with P0–P3
  QUESTIONS.md             what the agent needs a human for
  LOG.md                   one entry per finished pass
  specs/ research/ archive/
  reviews/inbox/           drop raw reviews here
.claude/skills/review-intake/
scripts/check_docs.sh      guard: markdown only where the map allows
.githooks/pre-commit       runs the guard on staged files
```

The managed block in `AGENTS.md` holds only the charter: where each kind of note goes, how to finish a pass, and which file wins when instructions conflict. Your common rules stay in the global configs, so no session loads them twice. Anything project-specific goes above the block. agentdrop never rewrites that part.

## Docs in the code repo, or not

The first time agentdrop sets up a git project, it asks where the docs and agent files (`docs/`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.githooks/`, `.docs-allow`, `scripts/check_docs.sh`) should live:

1. **track**: in the project's own repo, committed with the code. This is the default.
2. **separate**: in a second, local-only git in the same folder, `.git-docs`. The code repo ignores those paths through `.git/info/exclude`, the pre-commit guard moves to `.git-docs`, and `AGENTS.md` tells agents to commit docs with `git --git-dir=.git-docs --work-tree=. commit`. Nothing from it reaches GitHub.
3. **local**: the same paths ignored by the code repo, with no version control at all.

The answer is saved in the repo's local git config (`agentdrop.docs`), so later runs keep the docs where you put them. A folder that already has a `.git-docs` counts as "separate". To change your mind, run `agentdrop --docs track|separate|local .`. agentdrop never deletes `.git-docs` and never untracks files by itself. If docs were already committed to the code repo, it prints the `git rm --cached` command; the old commits keep them until you rewrite history with `git filter-repo`.

Without a terminal (CI, a pipe) there is no question: the docs stay in the code repo for that run and nothing is saved. Pass `--docs` there.

## Reviews without the mess

You ask three models to critique the project and end up with three overlapping markdown files in random places. Drop them anywhere, then tell your agent:

> process the reviews

The `review-intake` skill then works in two steps:

1. It collects every review file, splits them into single findings and merges duplicates across models (with a "who said it" column). It checks each finding against `DECISIONS.md` and the existing tickets, then assigns P0–P3 on its own scale and writes one summary into `docs/reviews/inbox/`. Then it stops and waits for you.
2. You answer "ok" or give corrections like "7 → P1, 12 → reject". After that it files the tickets, moves the raw reviews to `docs/archive/reviews/<date>/` and logs the pass.

`check_docs.sh` keeps new stray files from piling up. The pre-commit hook blocks a commit that adds markdown outside the map. In Claude Code, a Stop hook warns you without blocking the agent. If a project needs extra places for docs, list them as regexes in `.docs-allow`.

## Talk to the agent in your docs

```sh
agentdrop forum install     # macOS: a LaunchAgent on :5290, reachable from your phone on home Wi-Fi
agentdrop forum url         # the phone link (with a key; open once, then add to the home screen)
agentdrop forum             # or just run it in the foreground, this machine only
```

One small server shows every agentdrop project it finds under `~/Projects`, `~/code`, `~/src` and `~/Downloads` (the kit layout or an older one with notes in the root), plus any you add with `agentdrop forum add PATH`. Each project has its own docs and threads. Tap "Discuss" under a ticket or a question and write. The comment goes into the markdown under that item. A background `claude -p` run in that project's directory, limited to read-only tools, writes the reply into the same thread, usually within a minute. The feed collects threads from all projects and marks new answers and comments still waiting for one. "Ask the agent" starts a new topic in `QUESTIONS.md`.

The agent can't change files from the forum. If you ask for real work, it replies with a plan and the next working session does it; that session also commits the threads. Settings (your name, the agent's name, `"lang": "ru"`, roots, port, the agent command) live in `~/.agentdrop/forum.json`. Without `--lan` the server listens on 127.0.0.1 only; with it, every request from another device needs the key from `~/.agentdrop/forum_token`.

## Customize

- **Rules:** `agentdrop edit`, then `agentdrop sync`.
- **Charter and templates:** edit files in `~/.agentdrop/kit/`, then run `agentdrop .` in a project. Only missing files are copied; the charter block is refreshed every time.

## Older layouts

If a project already keeps `HANDOFF.md`, `PROGRESS.md` and similar files in the root, agentdrop leaves them as they are and doesn't add the `docs/` kit. Ask your agent to migrate the notes to `docs/`, then run `agentdrop .` again.
